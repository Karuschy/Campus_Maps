# Project Title
Western GIS

The product that we are developing will be used by students of the University of Western Ontario as a navigation tool. This application will provide a useful toolkit for browsing building maps, and setting personalized waypoints. User data for waypoints will be persistent and saved in their system files, where they can log back in, and access them at a later date. Western students who use the application will have an easier time locating their classes, and other rooms as they attend school.


## Libraries
These collections of libraries were used in the project

All of these libraries are already imported into the project and none of them need to be downloaded outside the project:

- javax.sound (version 8)
- java.io (version 8)
- java.util (version 8)
## Building the Software

The driver class is used in the program to build all of the other components of the system to get the software ready to run. Running the Driver.java class will not only build the software componets but will also run the program as indicated below.
## Running the Software

Running the software is very simple. Once the program is built in eclipse or whatever IDE you use, run the Driver.java class as a Java application and it will execute.
## User Guide

To start, you must create an account then login to the program using the information created. Then, select a building and floor to view.

The POIs are all clickable and more information will be displayed if clicked on. Layers of POIs can be turned on and off on the left side of the screen. All discoverable POIs on the map and floor will be displayed on the right.

All POIs can be set as favourties to the user and will be displayed on the right below the discoverable POIs. Also, the user can create their own POIs on any building/floor and will also be displayed below the favourties.

The user can change buildings/floors at any time and all information on other buildings/floors will remain. The user can press the back button to return to the login screen.
## Accounts

To login to the software, you would create an account and sign up on the program. Then you can login with the username and password used to create the account
## Editor Mode
To run the program in editing mode, you put the command -edit on the command line to tell the program to run in editing mode.

Then everything else is the same except when you login, you will have fully access to changing the POIs and everything else involved in editing mode.
